        <h2>Short About Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</h2>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi (1869–1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who led India’s non-violent independence movement against British rule. Known for his philosophy of Satyagraha (truth and non-violence), Gandhi employed civil disobedience, peaceful protests, and boycotts to challenge British authority. His leadership during pivotal moments, such as the Salt March (1930) and Quit India Movement (1942), mobilized millions in India.<br>

Gandhi's principles of non-violence influenced civil rights movements worldwide, including leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela. Tragically, he was assassinated in 1948 by a Hindu nationalist who opposed his vision of religious tolerance and unity.</p>

            1. "It always seems impossible until it's done."<br>
            2. "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it."<br>

    4. "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."<br>
    5. "I am not a saint, unless you think of a saint as a sinner who keeps on trying."<br>
    6. "I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."<br>
    7. "No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite."<br>
    8. "There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living."<br>
    9. "Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. Like slavery and apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings."<br>

    11. "Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies."<br>

    15. "What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others that will determine the significance of the life we lead."<br>
    16. "Difficulties break some men but make others. No axe is sharp enough to cut the soul of a sinner who keeps on trying, one armed with the hope that he will rise even in the end."<br>
    17. "I never lose. I either win or learn."<br>
    18. "There is no easy walk to freedom anywhere, and many of us will have to pass through the valley of the shadow of death again and again before we reach the mountaintop of our desires."<br>
    19. "When people are determined, they can overcome anything."<br>
    20. "Reconciliation means working together to correct the legacy of past injustice."<br></i></p>
    <p style="font-size:18px">Nelson Mandela (1918–2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who became the country's first Black president from 1994 to 1999.

His leadership in dismantling apartheid and fostering a peaceful transition to democracy made him a global symbol of resilience, justice, and forgiveness. Mandela’s legacy continues to inspire movements for human rights and social justice worldwide.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Short about <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong></h2>
        <p style="font-size:18px">Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) was a German politician and leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi Party). He became Chancellor of Germany in 1933 and later Führer in 1934, establishing a totalitarian regime characterized by extreme nationalism, militarism, and racism. Hitler is infamous for initiating World War II by invading Poland in 1939 and for orchestrating the Holocaust, which led to the systematic genocide of six million Jews and millions of others deemed "undesirable." His aggressive expansionist policies and totalitarian rule resulted in widespread destruction and loss of life. Hitler died by suicide in 1945 as Allied forces closed in on Berlin, marking the end of the Nazi regime. His legacy is a stark reminder of the dangers of totalitarianism, hatred, and intolerance.</p>
